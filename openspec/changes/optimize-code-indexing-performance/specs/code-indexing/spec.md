## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Incremental Code Indexing
The system SHALL support incremental indexing of code files to optimize performance for large codebases.

#### Scenario: Incremental index update for modified files
- **WHEN** a user enables incremental indexing and files are modified
- **THEN** the system SHALL only index the modified files instead of the entire codebase
- **AND** the system SHALL detect file changes using content hash comparison
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain a change tracking database

#### Scenario: Incremental index update for new files
- **WHEN** new files are added to the codebase
- **THEN** the system SHALL detect and index only the new files
- **AND** the system SHALL update the change tracking database

#### Scenario: Incremental index update for deleted files
- **WHEN** files are deleted from the codebase
- **THEN** the system SHALL remove the corresponding entries from the vector database
- **AND** the system SHALL update the change tracking database

### Requirement: Index Progress Display and Cancellation
The system SHALL provide real-time progress feedback and support cancellation during indexing operations.

#### Scenario: Progress display during indexing
- **WHEN** an indexing operation is in progress
- **THEN** the system SHALL display current progress percentage
- **AND** the system SHALL show estimated time remaining
- **AND** the system SHALL display the currently processing file

#### Scenario: Cancel indexing operation
- **WHEN** a user cancels an ongoing indexing operation
- **THEN** the system SHALL stop processing immediately
- **AND** the system SHALL clean up any partial data
- **AND** the system SHALL restore the previous index state

### Requirement: Intelligent Caching Strategy
The system SHALL implement a multi-level caching strategy to reduce redundant computations.

#### Scenario: Cache hit for identical content
- **WHEN** indexing a file with identical content to a previously indexed file
- **THEN** the system SHALL reuse the cached vector representation
- **AND** the system SHALL skip the embedding generation step

#### Scenario: Cache management with LRU policy
- **WHEN** the cache reaches its size limit
- **THEN** the system SHALL evict least recently used entries
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain cache statistics

### Requirement: Index State Persistence and Recovery
The system SHALL support persistence of indexing state to enable recovery from interruptions.

#### Scenario: Index state persistence
- **WHEN** an indexing operation is in progress
- **THEN** the system SHALL periodically save the current state
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain a checkpoint mechanism

#### Scenario: Recovery from interruption
- **WHEN** an indexing operation is interrupted and restarted
- **THEN** the system SHALL resume from the last checkpoint
- **AND** the system SHALL validate data integrity
- **AND** the system SHALL complete any incomplete operations

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Batch Vector Storage Operations
The vector storage system SHALL be optimized to support efficient batch operations for improved performance.

#### Scenario: Batch insertion of vectors
- **WHEN** multiple vectors need to be stored
- **THEN** the system SHALL process them in batches of configurable size
- **AND** the system SHALL use transaction-based operations for consistency
- **AND** the system SHALL provide progress feedback for batch operations

#### Scenario: Batch deletion of vectors
- **WHEN** multiple vectors need to be removed
- **THEN** the system SHALL process deletions in batches
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain referential integrity
- **AND** the system SHALL optimize storage space after deletions

### Requirement: Performance Monitoring and Optimization
The indexing system SHALL provide monitoring capabilities and performance optimization features.

#### Scenario: Performance metrics collection
- **WHEN** indexing operations are performed
- **THEN** the system SHALL collect performance metrics
- **AND** the system SHALL track memory usage and processing time
- **AND** the system SHALL provide performance reports

#### Scenario: Automatic performance optimization
- **WHEN** performance metrics indicate suboptimal performance
- **THEN** the system SHALL automatically adjust batch sizes and concurrency
- **AND** the system SHALL provide optimization recommendations
