## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Intelligent Request Caching

#### Scenario: Cache miss with automatic population
- **WHEN** a cache miss occurs for a new request
- **THEN** the system SHALL make the API call
- **AND** the system SHALL store the result in cache
- **AND** the system SHALL return the result to the user

#### Scenario: Cache expiration and cleanup
- **WHEN** cached entries reach their expiration time
- **THEN** the system SHALL automatically remove expired entries
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain cache size within configured limits
- **AND** the system SHALL use LRU policy for eviction

### Requirement: Optimized Token Calculation
The system SHALL provide efficient token calculation with caching and incremental updates.

#### Scenario: Incremental token calculation
- **WHEN** calculating tokens for a modified text
- **THEN** the system SHALL only recalculate tokens for changed portions
- **AND** the system SHALL reuse cached token counts for unchanged parts
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain calculation accuracy

#### Scenario: Batch token calculation
- **WHEN** calculating tokens for multiple texts
- **THEN** the system SHALL process them in batches for efficiency
- **AND** the system SHALL provide progress feedback
- **AND** the system SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement: Request Timeout and Retry Mechanism
The system SHALL implement robust timeout and retry mechanisms for AI API calls.

#### Scenario: Request timeout handling
- **WHEN** an AI API request exceeds the configured timeout
- **THEN** the system SHALL cancel the request
- **AND** the system SHALL return a timeout error to the user
- **AND** the system SHALL log the timeout event

#### Scenario: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **WHEN** an AI API request fails due to temporary issues
- **THEN** the system SHALL automatically retry the request
- **AND** the system SHALL use exponential backoff strategy
- **AND** the system SHALL respect maximum retry limits

### Requirement: Concurrency Control
The system SHALL implement intelligent concurrency control to manage API rate limits and resource usage.

#### Scenario: Dynamic concurrency adjustment
- **WHEN** API rate limits are detected
- **THEN** the system SHALL automatically reduce concurrent requests
- **AND** the system SHALL queue excess requests
- **AND** the system SHALL gradually increase concurrency when limits allow

#### Scenario: Request queue management
- **WHEN** multiple requests are queued
- **THEN** the system SHALL process them in priority order
- **AND** the system SHALL provide queue status to users
- **AND** the system SHALL handle queue overflow gracefully

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Enhanced AI Provider Interface
The AI provider interface SHALL be enhanced to support batch operations and performance optimizations.

#### Scenario: Batch request processing
- **WHEN** multiple similar requests are made
- **THEN** the system SHALL combine them into batch operations where possible
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain individual request tracking
- **AND** the system SHALL provide batch progress feedback

#### Scenario: Provider-specific optimizations
- **WHEN** using different AI providers
- **THEN** the system SHALL apply provider-specific optimization strategies
- **AND** the system SHALL adapt request parameters for optimal performance
- **AND** the system SHALL handle provider-specific limitations

### Requirement: Performance Monitoring and Analytics

#### Scenario: Real-time performance metrics
- **WHEN** AI operations are performed
- **THEN** the system SHALL collect response time metrics
- **AND** the system SHALL track token usage statistics
- **AND** the system SHALL monitor error rates

#### Scenario: Performance optimization recommendations
- **WHEN** performance metrics indicate suboptimal performance
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide optimization recommendations
- **AND** the system SHALL automatically adjust configuration parameters
- **AND** the system SHALL notify users of performance issues
